# cool-kids-bot
A discord bot used in my personal discord server.

## Creating a new feature

1. Create a new js file in the bots folder.
2. This bot uses discord.js for the bot and winston for the logging. So all those features can be used in your new js file.
3. All of the currently available events are visible in base-discord-bot.js. Feel free to use those or add your own.
4. easy-discord.js contains a few things to make working with discord.js easier.
